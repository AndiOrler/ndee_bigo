THEORY

//Complexity

Time complexity: Describes the change of execution time of an algorithm depending on the change of the size of the input data

Space complexity: Describes how much additional memory an algorithm needs depending on the size of the input data

//Complexity classes

>> O(1)
constant time, independent of number of input elements n
e.g. access an element in an array  array[i]

>> O(n)
Linear complexity, if input n is doubled, the effort is double as well
e. g. summing elements of an array

>> O(nÂ²)


>> O(log n)


>> O(n log n)
